# Story 9.5: Informational Display Command

## Status
Done

## Implementation Gap Note
**⚠️ PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION (2025-01-21):**
- `status` and `logs` commands exist as stubs but return "not yet implemented"
- Commands registered in CLI but functionality missing
- `geusemaker/cli/commands/status.py` returns "Status not yet implemented"
- `geusemaker/cli/commands/logs.py` returns "Logs retrieval not yet implemented"
- Required: Complete implementation of status and logs retrieval functionality

## Story

**As a** user with a running deployment,
**I want** a comprehensive info display command,
**so that** I can quickly access all deployment details.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `geusemaker info <name>` shows all deployment information
2. Display includes service endpoints with URLs
3. Display includes default credentials (if applicable)
4. Display includes estimated hourly cost
5. Display includes health status of all services
6. Display includes SSH access information
7. Display includes next steps and recommendations
8. Output supports JSON for scripting
9. Unit tests achieve 80%+ coverage
