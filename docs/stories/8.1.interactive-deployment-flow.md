1. `geusemaker deploy` without parameters starts interactive mode
2. Interactive mode guides through each configuration step
3. Each step includes explanations of options
4. Resource discovery results are displayed for selection
5. Cost estimates are shown before deployment confirmation
6. User can abort at any step without creating resources
7. Progress is displayed during deployment
8. Final summary shows access information
9. Unit tests achieve 80%+ coverage
