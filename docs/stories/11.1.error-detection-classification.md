# Story 11.1: Error Detection and Classification

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** developer troubleshooting issues,
**I want** errors to be properly detected and classified,
**so that** I can quickly understand what went wrong.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. AWS API errors are detected and classified by type
2. Resource creation failures are identified with details
3. Service deployment failures are detected
4. Configuration errors are caught early
5. Network issues are detected and reported
6. Error classification includes severity level
7. Error codes are unique and documented
8. Error context includes operation and resource info
9. Unit tests achieve 80%+ coverage
