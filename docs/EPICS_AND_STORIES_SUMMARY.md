**Generated:** 2025-11-21
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-21
**Codebase Review Date:** 2025-12-08
**Status Snapshot:** 14 epics / 59 stories — Draft: 1 epic, 15 stories; In Progress: 2 epics, 0 stories; Ready: 1 epic, 0 stories; Done: 10 epics, 44 stories

**✅ RECENT COMPLETIONS (2025-12-08):**
- **Epic 12 Complete:** Tier 2 ALB orchestration fully implemented
  - Tier2Orchestrator: 256 LOC with comprehensive error handling and rollback
  - ALB cleanup added to DestructionService
  - 5 new unit tests, all 212 tests passing
- **Next:** Tier 3 GPU/CloudFront orchestration (Epic 13)

**📋 NEWLY DESIGNED (2025-12-21):**
- **Epic 14:** ComfyUI Integration for LTX-2 Video Generation
  - Designed integration for ComfyUI service with LTX-2 custom nodes
  - Requires GPU tier deployments (Epic 13)
  - 4 stories covering service integration, health checks, LTX-2 setup, and NGINX proxy

**✅ Codebase Health:** Grade **A**
- 100% test pass rate (212 tests, +5 from Tier2Orchestrator)
- 0 type errors, 0 lint errors
- 14,642 production LOC (+512), 6,082 test LOC (+437)
- Test coverage: 41.6% (was 39.9%)
- See detailed analysis: [docs/CODEBASE_REVIEW.md](CODEBASE_REVIEW.md)

**✅ Recent Completions (2025-12-08):**
- **Epic 12 Complete:** Tier2Orchestrator with ALB support
  - New: `geusemaker/orchestration/tier2.py` (256 LOC)
  - Updated: `geusemaker/services/destruction/service.py` (ALB cleanup)
  - Tests: `tests/unit/test_orchestration/test_tier2.py` (437 LOC, 5 tests)
- ALB Service expanded: 42 → 274 LOC with 5 new methods

**Note:** Story statuses are taken from the individual story files. Epics 1–9 are complete. Epics 11–13 are partially complete (services implemented, orchestrators pending). Epic 14 (ComfyUI/LTX-2) is newly designed and pending implementation.

**Terminology Clarification:** `RollbackService` handles versioned state rollbacks, while orchestrator cleanup (`Tier1Orchestrator._cleanup_partial_deployment`) deletes partial resources after failures. Use the former for restoring prior configs; rely on the latter for failure cleanup.

  - **Proposed Solution**: Store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager or Systems Manager Parameter Store
  - **Implementation**: 
    - Create secrets in Secrets Manager/Parameter Store during deployment
    - Grant EC2 instance profile permissions to read secrets
    - Update UserData scripts to fetch secrets at runtime (not embed them)
    - Update docker-compose to use secrets from environment (fetched via AWS CLI/SDK)
  - **Benefits**: 
    - No secrets in UserData logs or instance metadata
    - Centralized secret management and rotation
    - Audit trail via CloudTrail
    - Compliance with security best practices
  - **Considerations**: 
    - Additional IAM permissions required
    - Slight increase in instance startup time (secrets fetch)
    - Cost: Secrets Manager charges per secret ($0.40/month + $0.05/10K API calls)
    - Parameter Store Standard is free, Advanced tier ($0.05/parameter/month)
