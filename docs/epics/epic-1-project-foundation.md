# Epic 1: Project Foundation and Core Infrastructure

## Epic Goal

Establish the foundational project structure, CLI framework, core data models, and infrastructure components required for building the GeuseMaker deployment orchestration system.

## Epic Description

**Context:**
This is the initial epic that sets up the project foundation. It establishes the Python project structure, CLI entry point, core Pydantic models, AWS client infrastructure, and state management - all prerequisites for subsequent development.

**Requirements from PRD:**
- Foundation for all subsequent features
- Core infrastructure components

**Success Criteria:**
- Python project structure matches architecture specification
- CLI entry point is functional
- Core models are implemented
- AWS client factory is in place
- State management infrastructure exists
- All code follows coding standards

## Stories

1. **Story 1.1:** Project Foundation and Core Infrastructure Setup
   - Python project structure
   - CLI entry point and branding
   - Core Pydantic models (DeploymentConfig, DeploymentState)
   - AWS client factory
   - State management infrastructure
   - Project configuration files
   - Unit tests with 80%+ coverage

## Dependencies

- No dependencies (foundational epic)
- Blocks: All other epics require this foundation

## Definition of Done

- [x] Python project structure matches architecture spec
- [x] CLI entry point displays branding and works
- [x] Core Pydantic models are implemented
- [x] AWS client factory is functional
- [x] State management infrastructure is in place
- [x] All code follows coding standards
- [x] Unit tests achieve 80%+ coverage (100% achieved)
