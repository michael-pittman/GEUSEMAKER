Place optional binaries here to speed up provisioning (copied to /usr/local/bin or /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins by UserData):
- Docker Compose plugin binary named `docker-compose` or `docker-compose-linux-x86_64`
- Any helper scripts your stack needs

Files in this directory are bundled when `use_runtime_bundle` is enabled.
